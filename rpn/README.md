# Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
## Description of the problem

Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.
Valid operators are +, -, `*`, / and ^ (power). Each operand may be an number
or an operator. For example:
* `["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]` is `((2 + 1) * 3) = 9`
* `["4", "13", "5", "/", "+", "10", "*"]` is `(4 + (13 / 5)) * 10 = 66`
* `["2", "3", "^"]` is `2 ^ 3 = 8`
